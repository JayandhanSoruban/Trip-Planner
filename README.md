# Trip-Planner
AI Travel Agent &amp; Expense Planner(Purpose: Trip planning for any city worldwide with Realtime data.") 

• Real-time weather information
• Top attractions and activities
• Hotel cost calculation (per day × total days)
• Currency conversion to user's native currency
• Complete itinerary generation
• Total expense calculation
• generate a summary of the entire output


1. Requirements & Planning
Before writing code, you need to capture the core requirements:

Realtime Data Integration: Get current weather and forecasts.

Local Search: Retrieve top attractions, restaurants, activities, transportation.

Hotel Cost Estimation: Find hotel rates, calculate cost per day, total cost.

Currency Conversion: Translate costs from local currency (USD, etc.) to the user’s native currency.

Itinerary Generation: Generate a detailed plan day-by-day with all selected activities.

Expense Planning & Summary: Calculate the total costs and present a summary to the user.

Key Considerations:

API integrations (free open-source APIs like OpenWeatherMap, OpenTripMap, Exchange Rate APIs, etc.).

User Input Validation & Error Handling.

Environment Management: Use .env for API keys and configuration.

Logging & Monitoring: Integrate logging (e.g., using loguru) and handle exceptions gracefully.

Modularity via OOP Design: Each major functionality should be implemented as its own class/module.

Testability and Maintainability: Write unit tests and use dependency injection where possible.

2. Project Structure & Modules
High-Level Architecture
Your project is broken down into several services (modules) that collaborate under a central controller (the TripPlanner class). The suggested folder structure is:

bash

├── services/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── weather.py         # WeatherService: handles current weather and forecast.
│   ├── location.py        # LocationService: queries attractions, restaurants, etc.
│   ├── hotels.py          # HotelService: searches hotels and estimates cost.

Module Responsibilities
WeatherService (services/weather.py)

Methods: get_current_weather(city), get_forecast(city, days)

Responsibilities: Query OpenWeatherMap (or similar) for realtime data and forecasts.

LocationService (services/location.py)

Methods: search_attractions(city), search_restaurants(city), search_activities(city)

Responsibilities: Use APIs (like OpenTripMap or Foursquare) to fetch points of interest.

HotelService (services/hotels.py)

Methods: search_hotels(city, budget_range), estimate_cost(city, num_days)

Responsibilities: Retrieve hotel options, simulate/mimic real data if needed, compute daily and total costs.

CurrencyConverter (services/currency.py)

Methods: get_exchange_rate(from_currency, to_currency), convert(amount, from_currency, to_currency)

Responsibilities: Use an API (like Forex-Python or Frankfurter) to convert currencies.

ItineraryGenerator (services/itinerary.py)

Methods: generate_day_plan(date, activities), create_full_itinerary(user_preferences)

Responsibilities: Combine weather info, attractions, and activities into a coherent itinerary.

BudgetCalculator (services/budget.py)

Methods: calculate_total(expenses), calculate_daily_budget(total_cost, num_days)

Responsibilities: Aggregation and calculation of total travel costs and daily breakdown.

TripSummaryGenerator (services/summary.py)

Methods: generate_summary(data)

Responsibilities: Create a final summary including weather, locations, hotel costs, total expenses, and the itinerary.

TripPlanner (planner.py)

Responsibilities: Serve as the central controller that:

Gathers user inputs (city, dates, budget, currency).

Coordinates calls to the different services.

Builds the final trip plan and compiles output.

Handles errors and logs issues.

Run Script (run.py)

Responsibilities: Entry point to run the application (could be a CLI or a simple UI trigger).

3. Detailed Workflow
Step 1: User Input Collection
Input: City, travel dates, preferred budget range, currency.

How: Via CLI input prompts or through a web form (if built with Flask/FastAPI).

Validation: Ensure valid city names and that dates and budgets are numeric where applicable.

Step 2: Service Calls & Data Retrieval
Weather Data: The WeatherService retrieves current weather and forecast data.

Attractions & Activities: The LocationService searches for points of interest.

Hotel Data: The HotelService provides hotel options and cost estimates.

Currency Conversion: The CurrencyConverter fetches and applies the conversion rate.

Each service handles its API calls, error checking (e.g., timeouts, invalid responses), and logs results for debugging.

Step 3: Data Aggregation & Itinerary Generation
Budget Calculation: The BudgetCalculator sums up costs from hotels, activities, transportation, etc.

Itinerary Assembly: The ItineraryGenerator processes the gathered data (weather, attractions) and creates a day-by-day plan.

Data Fusion: The TripSummaryGenerator gathers all the outputs (itinerary, total cost, currency conversion) to build a user-friendly summary.

Step 4: Output Generation & Presentation
Output: A complete trip plan, including detailed itineraries for each day, total expense estimates, and a summary.

Output Formats: Could be JSON, a neatly printed console output, or rendered via a web framework.

Error Reporting: Any API failures or missing data are logged and gracefully handled—possibly with default fallback values or user messages.

Step 5: Logging & Exception Handling
Logging: Use a logging framework (e.g., loguru) across services for tracking API calls and errors.

Exception Handling: Each service catches its own exceptions (e.g., network errors, parse errors) and returns friendly messages to the TripPlanner controller.

Step 6: Testing & Deployment Preparation
Unit Tests: Create tests for each service (e.g., mock API responses) ensuring the correct operation.

Integration Tests: Test how modules interact under simulated user inputs.

CI/CD Pipeline: Set up GitHub Actions or another CI tool to run tests on each push.

Deployment: Containerize the application (if needed) and deploy to a server or cloud platform, ensuring environment variables are secure and not hard-coded.

4. Development Best Practices
OOP & Modular Design
Encapsulation: Each service is its own class; they expose only what is needed to the central controller.

Loose Coupling: Services interact via clearly defined interfaces. For example, the TripPlanner doesn’t need to know the internal workings of the WeatherService.

Extensibility: New modules (e.g., restaurant recommendations, transportation tips) can be added without rewriting core logic.

Configuration Management
Environment Variables: Use the .env file for API keys and configuration.

config.py Module: Optionally, centralize configuration loading for easy maintenance.

Logging & Monitoring
Granular Logging: Each module logs its start, successful API calls, and error conditions.

Error Handling: Use try/except blocks to catch exceptions and return meaningful errors up the chain.

Documentation & Code Reviews
Comments and Docstrings: Document each class and function.

README & Wiki: Clearly outline installation steps, usage, and developer guidelines.

Code Reviews: Adopt peer reviews to ensure code quality before merging to main.
